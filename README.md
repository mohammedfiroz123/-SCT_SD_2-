Random Number Guessing Game: A fun, interactive game built using Python's Tkinter library for backend logic, with HTML and JavaScript for the frontend interface. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.
This includes the mention of HTML and JavaScript for the frontend.
